# Roll-Ball-in-VR
This is my first virtual reality based game for learning purpose. It is a simple rolling ball game in Virtual Reality(VR) environment.
You can open the project with unity version 2019.4.3f1 or higher.
To play the game in VR environment It is necessary to use the Oculus Rift(HMD) and controllers.

The main task of the game is to roll the ball and vanish the yellow boxes to get scores. Vanishing all of the boxes means, you have won the game. You can see your scores at the corner of the screen written as "Count" while you are in VR(wearing HMD). After collecting all of the boxes, you will win the game.

It is possible to controll or roll the ball by using both "Oculus Rift(HMD) controllers" and the arrow keys of PC's keyboard. When using the controller, the left thumbstick controlls the ball. For grabbing the ball, use the grip button (any of them or both left and right buttons).
